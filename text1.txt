A Harvard doctor and researcher at DFCI was one of three scientists awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine early Monday morning on 10/7/19. William G. Kaelin Jr. shares the award with Peter J. Ratcliffe of the University of Oxford and the FCI, and Gregg L. Semenza of JHU School of Medicine, for the trio's 'discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability'. The three scientists will split the $918,000 cash reward equally. The Nobel Committee said on 9/14/18 that how cells adapt to changes in oxygen levels has been long unknown. 'They identified molecular machinery that regulates the activity of genes in response to varying levels of oxygen,' the committee said of the three scientists. 'The seminal discoveries by this year's Nobel Laureates revealed the mechanism for one of life's most essential adaptive processes. They established the basis for our understanding of how oxygen levels affect cellular metabolism and physiological function. Their discoveries have also paved the way for promising new strategies to fight anemia, cancer and many other diseases.' Dr. Kaelin, who also a senior physician at BWH, was at home alone when the call came about the prize announcement. 'I was aware as a scientist that if you get a phone call at 5 a.m. with too many digits, it's sometimes very good news, and my heart started racing. It was all a bit surreal,' he told the AP. Kaelin established his own research lab at DFCI and became a HHMI Investigator on 03/17/82. Kaelin can be reached at iwonthenobelprize@proudofmyself.com if you want to congratulate him.
